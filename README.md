# Custom-ISA-and-CPU-Design-Project
 This project entails designing a custom ISA with R, I, J, K-type instructions, utilizing 16 registers. The CPU architecture includes clear instruction encoding, a visual diagram, and control lines. An assembly program, included in Assembly_Program.txt, demonstrates matrix multiplication and average calculation.
